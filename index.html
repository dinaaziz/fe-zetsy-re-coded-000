  Jewelry in the Americas has an ancient history. Beginning as far back as 8800 BCE, Paleo-Indians in the American <br> Southwest drilled and shaped multicolored stones and shells into beads and pendants. Olivella shell beads, dating  <br>from 6000 BCE, were found in Nevada; bone, antler, and possibly marine shell beads from 7000 BCE were found in <br> Russell Cave in Alabama; copper jewelry was traded from Lake Superior beginning in 3000 BCE; and stone beads were <br> carved in  Poverty Point in Louisiana in 1500 BCE.
